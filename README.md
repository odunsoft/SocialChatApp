# SocialChatApp
Social Chat Application With Firebase 


This was my first learning project so maybe it doesn' t include best practice for methods or usages. And don't care the design of application.
You have to connect to new Firebase realtime database if you want to use. ( I had to disconnect because I had a technical failure in firebase )

Projects has:
- Login / Register
- Sending a friend request
- Messaging
- Message and Request Notifications
- Delete All Messages Option
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Firebase Authentication With Email/Password
- Profile Design
- Forgot Password Activity
- Search Bar 
- Spinner Search With Countries
- Users Profile and Sending Request
- Settings etc.
